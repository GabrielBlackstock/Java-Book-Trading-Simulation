## Overview

The project simulates interactions between book buyers and sellers. Buyers can request books, and if no seller has the requested book, the buyer can choose to add it to a request queue. Sellers can fulfill these requests by adding the books to their catalog.

## Features

- **Book Requests**: Buyers can request specific books.
- **Automatic Purchase**: If a book from a buyer's wish list becomes available at or below the desired price, it is automatically purchased.
- **Randomized Seller Selection**: New book requests are randomly assigned to sellers.
